Leaver_status:
{
DOTA_LEAVER_NONE = 0;
DOTA_LEAVER_DISCONNECTED = 1;
DOTA_LEAVER_DISCONNECTED_TOO_LONG = 2;
DOTA_LEAVER_ABANDONED = 3;
DOTA_LEAVER_AFK = 4;
DOTA_LEAVER_NEVER_CONNECTED = 5;
DOTA_LEAVER_NEVER_CONNECTED_TOO_LONG = 6;
}
in my experience, the TOO_LONG ones means they actually counted as abandons.
my interpretation:
1 - player dc
2 - player dc, left for longer than 5 mins, and is counted as abandoned
3 - player dc, and manually clicked on leave game, counted as abandon
4 - player is afk (no xp in certain time period)
5 - player never connected
6 - player never connected, game went on for some time and is counted as abandon (not sure about this one)
